# 👋 Hello, 你好，Bonjour

## 🌱 About me 
I am an incoming data scientist with previous internship experience as data analyst and business intelligence developer. 
I have a Master's degree in Management Analytics from McGill University, and Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Toronto. 
I enjoy working with numbers and mathematical logic, and I am passionate about programming and statistical/ML modeling.
Currently I am learning website development and operating systems, and hoping to switch to software development role in a year or two. 
On my free time, I like doing Muay Thai, outdoor activities, and photography!
