# 👋 Hello, 你好，Bonjour

## 🌱 About me 
Reliable, creative, and passionate would be the three words to best describe me.

I am Angela, a recent graduate from the program of Master of Management in Analytics at McGill University. I have an undergrad education background in Mathematics, Economics, and Statistics from the University of Toronto. I currently work as a Data Science Developer at Bell. 

I enjoy working with data, and I like to use data to help business solve problems. While my domain knowledge is Data Science/Analytics, I grow interest in software development as I want to understand the backend infrastructure and pipeline of all the clean data that is provided to me in my daily work, hence I am currently learning software development on my free time.

Outside of work, I like doing Muay Thai, travelling, and photography! ☺️
